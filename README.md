===
This filefolder contains two files for the [KDDCUP2015](https://kddcup2015.com/information.html):

1. `feature.py` shows how to extract features from the raw data. Noting that this file only consider the log_train data, the course infomation is not included in this code.

2. `stacking.py` shows how to build a two-level stacking model.

My final result is 71/821, which uses a blending model rather than the stacking model.
